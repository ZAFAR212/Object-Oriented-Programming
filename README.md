# Object-Oriented-Programming

Create a class definition for an Email which has four variables:
has_been_read, email_contents, is_spam and from_address.
 - The constructor should initialise the sender’s email address.
 - The constructor should also initialise has_been_read and is_spam to false.
 - Create a function in this class called mark_as_read which should change has_been_read to true.
 - Create a function in this class called mark_as_spam which should change is_spam to true.
 - Create a list called inbox to store all emails (note that you can have a list of objects).
 - Then create the following functions:
    ○ add_email - which takes in the contents and email address from the received email to make a new Email object.
    ○ get_count - returns the number of messages in the store.
    ○ get_email - returns the contents of an email in the list. For this, allow the user to input an index i.e. get_email(i) returns the email stored at position i in the list. Once this has been done, has_been_read should now be true.
    ○ get_unread_emails - should return a list of all the emails that haven’t been read.
    ○ get_spam_emails - should return a list of all the emails that have been marked as spam.
    ○ delete - deletes an email in the inbox.
